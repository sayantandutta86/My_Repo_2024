Excellent üëç Glad you found it useful.
Now let‚Äôs enrich each section further with more concrete, project-specific points that you can directly use when drafting the document.
This way, each ToC section won‚Äôt just be one sentence but will contain 2‚Äì4 concise bullets that give depth and clarity.
