Okay, I've reviewed the model documentation focusing on the sections you highlighted. Here are some probing questions and findings aimed at seeking clarification and exploring potential areas for discussion during the peer review, specifically concerning model development, methodology, testing, and the final model:
Peer Review Questions & Findings:
 * Section 3.2 (Business Requirements - History and Current Situation):
   * This section outlines the model's journey and enhancements up until late 2021/early 2022. To understand the current context better, could you share how the core business requirements for market abuse surveillance using this model have evolved since then, leading into the planned 2024/2025 updates?
 * Section 4.1.1 (In Scope):
   * The tables clearly define the entities and products currently covered. Looking ahead, particularly at the 2024 and 2025 updates, are there concrete plans to expand this scope to include additional entities, regions, or specific product subtypes not listed?
 * Section 4.3.1 (Model History):
   * The history mentions the development of a Cross Product Layering and Spoofing MVP in 2023. What were the primary challenges encountered and key insights gained during this MVP phase? How have these learnings shaped the approach for the further enhancements planned in 2024 and 2025?
 * Section 5.4 (Threshold decision):
   * The document notes that the specifics of threshold decision-making are documented elsewhere. Could you elaborate on the governance surrounding the setting, review, and adjustment of these critical thresholds? How often are they formally reviewed and potentially recalibrated based on model performance data or shifts in market behaviour?
 * Section 5.5.1 (Model Testing, Test Results and Test Conclusions):
   * While this section refers to separate documentation for detailed test results, could you provide a high-level overview of the back-testing strategy employed? What key performance indicators (KPIs) were used to evaluate the model's effectiveness during these tests (e.g., detection rates, false positive ratios)?
 * Section 5.5.2 (Model Governance and Compliance):
   * The described governance framework with the MMPS and MDRP appears thorough. How does this framework adapt to the nuances of overseeing a vendor-provided model like Trading Hub? Specifically, how is effective oversight maintained given the potential limitations on visibility into the vendor's proprietary algorithms mentioned elsewhere?
 * Section 7.4 (Front Running allocation algorithm):
   * The allocation algorithm incorporates a perturbation method to ensure stability against small input changes. Could you shed more light on how the final allocation weighting is derived after perturbation? Has sensitivity analysis been conducted to understand how different market conditions might affect this allocation?
 * Section 8.2 (Ramping alert scoring):
   * The USD Value calculation for ramping alerts incorporates a market impact component that decays over time. How is this decay factor determined and calibrated? Is it static, or does it adapt based on instrument type or market volatility?
 * Section 10.3 (Aggressive Facilitation):
   * This metric utilizes the Trading Hub Reporting tool to identify aggressively facilitated trades. What steps are taken to validate the logic within the reporting tool that flags a trade as "aggressively facilitated"? Is there an independent check on this bespoke logic outside of the vendor's environment?
 * Section 12.1 (Insider Trading Scoring):
   * The scoring identifies trades with high USD values before a significant price shock. A key challenge is distinguishing illegal insider trading from astute trading based on public information analysis. How does the model methodology attempt to differentiate these, particularly in how "price shock" events are defined and validated as being driven by non-public information?
 * 2024 Updates:
   * The 2024 roadmap includes substantial work on Client View and Wash Trading detection, involving threshold analysis by RCALA. Given that identifying wash trades can be complex, especially across diverse assets and conditions, what specific validation exercises confirmed that the RCALA framework adequately captures the intended risk across various scenarios?
   * Additionally, there's mention of an interim period between the expiry of a model change dispensation (Q1 2024) and the implementation of a new GMBP (end of 2024). What governance procedures are in place for managing necessary model changes during this specific timeframe?
 * 2025 Updates:
   * Plans for 2025 include introducing Cross Product Layering and Spoofing (CPLS) for Equities and a new RFQ Front Running metric. What specific surveillance gaps are these designed to close that aren't covered by existing metrics? What are the anticipated main challenges in developing, testing, and validating these new metrics, especially the novel RFQ Front Running concept?
I hope these points are helpful for your peer review discussion! Let me know if you need anything else.
