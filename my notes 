Okay, here are some probing questions and findings based on my review of the specified sections in the provided model documentation. I've tried to keep the tone constructive and aimed at encouraging clarification or further detail where needed.
Section 3.2: Business Requirements
 * Finding: The history describes the evolution from manual controls and initial implementations to the current MAST system.
 * Question: Could you elaborate on the specific limitations or failures of the previous surveillance systems (pre-MAST or early MAST versions) that necessitated the enhancements and expansions outlined, particularly concerning the types of market abuse that were not adequately covered?
Section 4.1.1: In Scope
 * Finding: The scope tables list Legal Entities and Products covered. There's mention of excluding structured products for FX Options.
 * Question: Regarding the exclusion of structured products for FX Options, what is the rationale for this exclusion, and is there an alternative control or plan to address potential market abuse risks associated with these specific products?
 * Finding: The document notes that Layering and Spoofing metrics apply differently across locations (e.g., London, NY, HK having visibility on electronic Deal-to-Market orders for FX).
 * Question: For Layering and Spoofing, could you clarify if the difference in applicability across locations leads to any potential surveillance gaps in regions where electronic order book visibility might be limited? How is this risk mitigated?
Section 4.3.1: Model History
 * Finding: The document details numerous updates and enhancements implemented over the years, including the introduction of new metrics, asset classes, and functionalities like Client View and Counterparty View.
 * Question: With the introduction of multiple bespoke controls (like Aggressive Facilitation, Multi-Trader Front Running) built using the MAST reporting tool, what process is in place to ensure these custom controls undergo the same level of rigor in terms of validation, threshold setting, and ongoing performance monitoring as the core vendor-provided metrics?
 * Question: The history mentions several instances where enhancements were made based on reviews (e.g., KPMG, RCALA) or specific needs (e.g., replacing legacy tools). Is there a formal process documented for periodically reassessing the model's effectiveness and coverage against evolving market practices and regulatory expectations, beyond specific triggers like audits or tool replacements?
Section 5.4: Threshold Decision
 * Finding: The section states that threshold decision-making is documented separately, including RCALA review documentation. It also notes thresholds might differ for Client View compared to Trader View.
 * Question: Could you provide more insight into the methodology used for setting the initial thresholds? Was it based purely on data analysis (e.g., percentile analysis), expert judgment, regulatory guidance, or a combination?
 * Question: Section 4.4 shows variations in alert rates per 10,000 trades across metrics and regions. How are thresholds reviewed and potentially recalibrated over time to account for changing market conditions, data volumes, or observed alert effectiveness, ensuring they remain meaningful without generating excessive noise or missing potential abuse?
Section 5.5.1: Model Testing - Test Results (Based on Section 4.4)
 * Finding: Section 4.4 provides tables showing alert volumes, closure categories, and alert rates per 10,000 trades for different metrics and regions.
 * Question: The data shows a significant number of alerts are closed as "Not Relevant" or "Not Relevant - data quality issue". While some level of false positives is expected, what analysis has been done on these categories to identify root causes (e.g., data quality problems, overly sensitive thresholds, metric logic limitations)? Are there specific action plans to address the main drivers of these non-productive alerts?
 * Question: Table showing alerts per 10k trades indicates variability across metrics/regions. For metrics/regions with very low or zero alert rates, has there been specific testing or analysis (like below-threshold analysis) to confirm that this reflects a lack of abusive behavior rather than a potential lack of model sensitivity?
Section 5.5.2: Model Testing - Test Conclusions (Based on Section 4.4)
 * Finding: Section 4.4 presents performance statistics. Acceptance criteria seem based on these operational statistics.
 * Question: Beyond the alert volume statistics presented, what qualitative conclusions were drawn from the model testing regarding its ability to correctly identify known market abuse typologies? Was sensitivity testing performed using seeded data or known historical cases?
Section 7.4: Front Running Allocation Algorithm
 * Finding: The allocation uses a 'perturbation' method, taking a weighted average of probabilities to reduce sensitivity to small timing changes.
 * Question: The document mentions perturbing trade timings by a 'small random fraction'. Could you elaborate on how the magnitude of this 'random fraction' is determined and whether sensitivity analysis was performed to ensure the allocation outcome isn't overly dependent on the specific random values used in the perturbation process?
Section 8.2: Ramping Identification
 * Finding: Ramping identification looks for a series of trades in one direction followed by a rapid reversal to realize profit from the price movement created. The score considers market impact and nominal height.
 * Question: How does the model differentiate between legitimate trading strategies that might involve building and unwinding a position quickly (e.g., market making, reacting to news) and potentially manipulative ramping activity? Are factors like order book depth, volatility, or news context considered alongside the trading pattern itself?
Section 10.3: Aggressive Facilitation
 * Finding: This bespoke control leverages MAST Front Running analytics but focuses on identifying instances where a trader aggressively executes a client order, potentially disadvantaging the client. It uses order length compared to a threshold to determine aggressiveness.
 * Question: How was the threshold for determining 'aggressiveness' based on order length established? Does this consider variations in market conditions or instrument liquidity where faster execution might be normal or even required? Is there a risk of misidentifying necessary rapid execution as 'aggressive'?
Section 12.1: Insider Trading Scoring
 * Finding: The scoring calculates a USD value based on trading activity preceding a price shock. Factors increasing the score include the size of the position built and the proximity of trading to the price shock. Intraday events are now used for Rates.
 * Question: The rationale provided suggests it's 'safer' for an inside trader to trade closer to the event. While plausible, could this assumption potentially down-weight suspicious activity that occurs further out from the event? How does the scoring model balance proximity with other factors like trade size or pattern consistency?
 * Question: For the enhanced Insider Trading metric for Rates using intraday analysis, how sensitive is the USD Value calculation to the accuracy and granularity of the intraday price data and event timestamps? What controls are in place to manage potential data quality issues here?
I hope these questions are helpful for your peer review exercise! Let me know if you need anything else.
