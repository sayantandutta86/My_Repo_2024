Here are some concise bullet points you can share with your stakeholders:

What the Keyword/Entity List Is

A curated set of domain-specific terms, phrases and entity names (e.g. “Outside Activity,” “ISA,” “ShareMatch”) that signal a query’s relevance to a particular policy area or request type.

Acts as a lookup/reference for our AI pipeline to spot key concepts and topics in incoming user queries.


Why It Matters

Precision & Coverage: Ensures our similarity and fuzzy-match engines don’t miss critical policy terms (reducing false negatives), while filtering out off-topic noise (reducing false positives).

Consistency: Guarantees that, over time, the same terms are treated the same way—crucial for auditability and regulatory compliance.

Speed & Scalability: Allows automated tagging of simple queries without human intervention, freeing SMEs to focus on genuinely complex cases.


Why SME Review Is Essential

Domain Accuracy: Only subject-matter experts can confirm that we’ve included all current policies, local variations and recent terminology changes.

Nuance & Context: SMEs help distinguish between homonyms or overlapping terms (e.g. “IPO” in compliance vs. marketing), preventing misclassification.

Ongoing Maintenance: Policies evolve—SME oversight ensures the list is regularly updated, so relevance tagging stays reliable as regulations and business practices change.



These points will help stakeholders understand both the technical role of the keyword list in your Gen-AI relevancy workflow and the critical need for expert validation.
