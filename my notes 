Here’s a clearer and more professional version of the note that you can share with business stakeholders:

Background:

AI will be leveraged to answer user queries using policy documents as contextual reference.

To initiate this process, we need to establish a benchmark. This requires a set of real user queries along with SME-reviewed answers that include citations from relevant policy documents. This “golden set” will serve as the foundation to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the AI-generated responses.

Ask from Analytics:

To move forward with solution design, we request stakeholders to support the creation of this golden set. Specifically:

Provide 30+ sample queries (covering both short and complex types).

Each query should have a corresponding SME-reviewed answer.

Answers must include clear citations/references from policy documents.


This input is essential to ensure that AI responses can be benchmarked against a credible, trusted source before deployment.
