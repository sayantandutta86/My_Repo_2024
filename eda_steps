Okay, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset with query text and metadata is crucial for understanding user behavior, operational efficiency, and potential areas for improvement. Here's a breakdown of initial EDA steps you can perform, categorized for clarity:
I. Basic Data Inspection & Setup
 * Load Data: Load your dataframe (e.g., using pandas in Python).
 * Dimensions: Check the number of rows (queries) and columns (features) (df.shape).
 * First Look: Display the first few and last few rows (df.head(), df.tail()) to get a feel for the data values and structure.
 * Column Names & Types: List all column names (df.columns) and check their data types (df.info() or df.dtypes).
   * Crucial: Ensure date columns (query creation date, advisor assignment date, query resolve date) are recognized as datetime objects. If not, convert them.
   * Check if location columns are strings (object) or categorical.
 * Basic Statistics (Numerical): Get descriptive statistics for any numerical columns (df.describe()). While you might not have many initially, this becomes important after calculating durations.
II. Data Quality Checks
 * Missing Values: Check for missing values in each column (df.isnull().sum()).
   * Understand why data might be missing (e.g., advisor assignment date or query resolve date might be missing if the query is still open).
   * Decide on a strategy for handling missing values (imputation, removal, or leaving them if meaningful).
 * Duplicates: Check for duplicate rows (df.duplicated().sum()). Decide if duplicates are expected or indicate an issue. You might also want to check for duplicates based only on the query text column.
 * Consistency Checks:
   * Dates: Verify logical consistency: query resolve date >= advisor assignment date >= query creation date. Identify any anomalies.
   * Categorical Values: Examine unique values in categorical columns like user location and responder location (df['user location'].unique()). Look for variations in spelling or formatting (e.g., "NY", "New York", "new york") that need standardization.
III. Univariate Analysis (Analyzing Single Columns)
 * Query Text Analysis (Basic):
   * Query Length: Calculate the length (number of characters or words) of each query text and add it as a new column.
   * Distribution of Query Length: Plot a histogram or density plot of query lengths. Are most queries short or long? Are there outliers?
   * Most Common Words (Simple): Perform basic text cleaning (lowercase, remove punctuation) and find the most frequent words. This gives a first glimpse into common topics. (More advanced NLP comes later).
 * Date Analysis:
   * Time Range: Find the minimum and maximum dates for creation, assignment, and resolution to understand the dataset's time span.
   * Distribution over Time: Plot the number of queries created per day, week, month, or year. Are there trends, seasonality, or specific peak times? (e.g., using df['query creation date'].dt.to_period('M').value_counts().sort_index().plot()).
 * Categorical Analysis (Locations, etc.):
   * Frequency Counts: Get value counts for user location, responder location, and any other categorical columns (df['user location'].value_counts()).
   * Visualizations: Use bar charts to visualize the distribution of queries across different locations. Are queries concentrated in specific areas?
IV. Time-Based Feature Engineering & Analysis
 * Calculate Durations: This is often highly insightful. Create new columns for:
   * time_to_assignment = advisor assignment date - query creation date
   * time_to_resolution = query resolve date - query creation date
   * assignment_to_resolution = query resolve date - advisor assignment date (time spent after assignment)
   * (Handle potential missing dates appropriately when calculating)
 * Analyze Duration Distributions:
   * Descriptive Statistics: Get min, max, mean, median, quantiles for these duration columns (df[['time_to_assignment', 'time_to_resolution']].describe()). The median is often more robust to outliers than the mean.
   * Visualizations: Use histograms and box plots to visualize the distribution of these durations. Are resolution times generally fast or slow? Are there many outliers (very long resolution times)?
V. Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis (Relationships Between Columns)
 * Location vs. Time:
   * Does time_to_resolution or time_to_assignment vary significantly based on user location or responder location? (Use box plots grouped by location: seaborn.boxplot(x='user location', y='time_to_resolution', data=df)).
 * Query Length vs. Time:
   * Does the length of the query correlate with time_to_resolution? (Use a scatter plot, potentially with transparency (alpha) due to data density, or calculate correlation).
 * Time Trends in Durations:
   * Plot the average or median time_to_resolution over time (e.g., per month or quarter). Is the resolution process getting faster or slower?
 * Location Interactions:
   * What are the most common user location to responder location pairings? (A cross-tabulation pd.crosstab(df['user location'], df['responder location']) visualized as a heatmap can be effective).
VI. Initial Text Insights (Going slightly deeper)
 * N-grams: After basic cleaning, look at common bigrams (two-word phrases) or trigrams (three-word phrases). This often reveals more context than single words (e.g., "password reset" instead of just "password" and "reset").
 * Keywords and Durations: Do queries containing specific keywords (identified from frequency analysis) tend to have longer or shorter resolution times?
Tools often used:
 * Python Libraries: Pandas (data manipulation), Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization), NLTK or spaCy (basic text processing).
By performing these initial steps, you'll gain a solid understanding of your data's structure, quality, distributions, and the basic relationships between query text, metadata, and time-based metrics like resolution speed. This forms the foundation for more advanced analysis or modeling.
