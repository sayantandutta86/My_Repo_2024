Thank you for sharing the UAT data.

We have reviewed the results for the three LLM-as-a-judge metrics â€” Completeness, Toxicity, and Faithfulness. Overall, our team is aligned with the provided outcomes. The majority of the responses appear consistent with expectations, and no major concerns were identified.

There were a few minor deviations observed in specific cases, which we have captured in our review sheet for reference. These deviations do not materially impact the overall assessment, and we agree with the methodology and evaluation approach adopted for R2.
