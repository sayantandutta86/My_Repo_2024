Agenda:Discussion and clarification on semantic search output in the final response format sent by the RCDP team.Review of real-time evaluation metrics.Meeting Notes:Semantic Search Output:The semantic search output is designated for the suggested response part. In production, 5 separate chunks will be received.The semantic search output format will remain consistent regardless of the retrieved policy source (e.g., GPPS and non-GPPS policy documents).RCDP will send sample semantic search output for GPPS and non-GPPS policy documents to Analytics for validation of format consistency across different policy sources.Agreed that RCDP will include a minor alteration to the semantic search output: Along with the chunk identifier, the file name (metadata-1) and section header (metadata-2) will also be presented as separate fields at the beginning of the output.Real-Time Evaluation Metrics:Wright with Ray confirmed that the output format will support real-time evaluation metrics seamlessly without disrupting the format for "latency" and "cost per response" fields.Gen-AI IT Team has completed API connectivity, enabling RCDP to showcase sample responses by the end of the week. Analytics will schedule the meeting accordingly to discuss the same.Agreed that the relevance threshold in Qsense code will be kept in a separate configuration file, ensuring that any changes to the keyword list or relevance threshold will not require production code redeployment.Action Items:RCDP Team: Send sample semantic search output for GPPS and non-GPPS policy documents to Analytics for format validation by [insert deadline, e.g., July 5, 2025].Analytics Team: Schedule a follow-up meeting with RCDP by the end of this week (July 4, 2025) to review the sample responses showcased via the Gen-AI IT Teamâ€™s API connectivity.Gen-AI IT Team: Ensure API connectivity is fully operational to support the scheduled showcase of sample responses by July 4, 2025.All Teams: Update the relevance threshold and keyword list in the separate configuration file as needed, ensuring no impact on production code deployment.Next Steps:Follow-up meeting to be scheduled post-validation of semantic search output and review of real-time evaluation metrics.Any additional concerns or updates to be communicated via email by July 6, 2025.
