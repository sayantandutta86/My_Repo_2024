Subject: Clarifications on RSR Examples and RCSR Risk Type Alignment

Hi Rajeev,

I’ve reviewed the shared RSR examples and wanted to confirm a few points before proceeding further:

1. Alignment Issue: Some request types in the shared examples don’t align with the current RSR request types in ASK Compliance. Should these be reclassified or excluded?


2. RCSR Definition: A detailed and standardized description of the Reputational, Climate, and Sustainability Risk (RCSR) category is needed for consistent mapping.


3. Sub-Type Details: Within RCSR, can we get clearer definitions for:

(i) General Reputational & Sustainability Risk Enquiry

(ii) Reputational Risk
Current descriptions in ASK Compliance seem quite limited.



4. Example Validation: Patrick confirmed 5 of the 11 examples align with RCSR. Should we finalize these as reference, or do we need further review?


5. Additional Samples: We’ll need at least 20 well-aligned examples for proper model integration. Can you confirm the source for additional samples?



Once we have clarity on these, we can proceed with taxonomy updates and dataset preparation.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
