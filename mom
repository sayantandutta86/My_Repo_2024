Minutes of Meeting: Employee Compliance Analytics & System Enhancements
Date: June 26, 2025
Attendees: Business Stakeholders, Analytics Team (Kavya, Sayantan), Technical Team (Suman)
Subject: Review of Employee Compliance Module, KPI Definition, and Feature Roadmap
Executive Summary
The meeting focused on defining key performance indicators (KPIs) and outlining system enhancements for the Employee Compliance module. Key decisions included the approval to develop a new KPI to track communication overhead ("Interaction Volume per Query") and the need to redesign the current advisor feedback system for improved clarity. Several action items were assigned to the analytics and technical teams to investigate data capture capabilities and track incoming query volume from the ongoing migration.
Key Decisions & Discussion Points
 * New KPI for Interaction Efficiency:
   * A new primary KPI, "Interaction Volume per Query," was proposed to measure the number of back-and-forth communications between advisors and users. The core objective is to reduce this metric, thereby alleviating pressure on Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
   * The strategic implementation of ABA (AI-Based Assistance) and AUA (Automated User Assistance) is expected to be the primary driver in reducing this KPI by delivering more comprehensive, first-touch responses.
 * Advisor Feedback System Overhaul:
   * The current two-level (L1/L2) advisor feedback mechanism is slated for a comprehensive review and redesign.
   * The existing model is considered potentially confusing for users and requires simplification to ensure the feedback captured is clear, actionable, and accurately reflects the user experience.
 * Project Update: Employee Compliance Migration:
   * The migration of "Employee Compliance" to the "ASK Compliance" platform has commenced as of June 2025.
   * The migration is planned in three tranches, and an initial influx of email-based queries is being observed.
Action Items (AI)
 * Feature Activation:
   * AI-01: Suman to investigate and enable the "Requestor Rating" feature for the Employee Compliance module to ensure parity with other active request types.
 * KPI & Measurement Development:
   * AI-02: Kavya/Sayantan to conduct a detailed analysis for the "Interaction Volume per Query" KPI. This includes defining the precise logic, data capture requirements, and establishing a baseline.
   * AI-03: Kavya/Sayantan to collaborate with Suman to create a robust methodology for tracking the incoming query volume resulting from the Employee Compliance migration.
   * AI-04: Kavya/Sayantan to define a new KPI, "Advisor Time-to-Respond (AI-Assisted)," by leveraging timestamps captured when an advisor accesses an AI-suggested response.
 * Technical Feasibility & Data Capture:
   * AI-05: Suman to determine the technical feasibility of capturing advisor click-stream data, specifically which policy documents or reference links are accessed during case resolution.
   * AI-06: The development team is to ensure that timestamps for advisor access to AI-generated suggestions are captured accurately to support AI-04.
Future Roadmap & Ideation
 * AI-Powered Response Formulation: A "Use of AI" feature, intended to help advisors formulate responses, is confirmed to be in the development pipeline.
 * Contextual Advisor Feedback: An idea was proposed to enhance the platform by incorporating contextual feedback mechanisms for the advisor. For example, after an advisor uses a system feature, they could be prompted with questions like, "Did you find the policy reference useful?" or "Was the system-suggested response clear?" This will be considered for future development sprints.
