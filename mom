Generate a concise MOM and it should look like written by senior analytics team member. Below are the raw notes:

Meeting attended by ASK Compliance product , RCDP, Analytics.

Suman/Megha to send EC Query types which are ADA eligible to RCDP.

It was agreed that a configuration file will be maintained which will map the query request types to their corresponding Qsense/Qradar components. For each query , its assigned request type will only trigger 
their mapped Qsense/Qradar components.

 RCDP team will make the required code changes in Qsense /Qradar to bake-in the configuration file in the code workflow to accomplish the above.

In the future whenever request types are modified/added, The change management procedure should invoke an alert/trigger to update the configuration file.
