Vision Document: Enhancing Compliance Query Management with Intelligent Self-Service Automation
This vision document outlines a comprehensive plan to evolve our compliance query management platform from its current human-review model to a hybrid system that intelligently automates simple queries while directing complex ones to human advisors.
Current State Assessment
Our organization has successfully implemented a compliance query platform that follows a structured workflow:
1.	Users submit compliance queries and select a "request type" that determines the knowledge base to query
2.	A query categorization framework evaluates each query through:
•	Query Sense: Assesses relevancy against policy documents
•	Query Radar: Evaluates complexity, approval requirements, and need for external system access
3.	LLM generates responses based on retrieved context from knowledge bases
4.	Human advisors receive the query, LLM response, and categorization guidance
5.	Advisors review and edit ALL responses before they reach users3
The current system is moving into production and provides valuable assistance to human advisors, but still requires their involvement for every query regardless of complexity.
Limitations of Current Approach
•	All queries require human review, creating potential bottlenecks
•	Advisor time is spent on both simple and complex queries
•	Response times are dependent on advisor availability
•	Scalability is limited by human capacity34
Vision and Strategic Objectives
Our vision is to transform the compliance query platform into an intelligent system that:
1.	Automatically resolves simple, straightforward compliance queries without human intervention
2.	Directs complex queries to human advisors who can provide nuanced expertise
3.	Continuously improves its classification accuracy through feedback loops
4.	Maintains or exceeds current compliance standards while improving efficiency
Strategic Objectives
•	Reduce response time for simple queries by 80%
•	Automate at least 50% of incoming queries within six months
•	Maintain or improve response accuracy compared to current system
•	Better utilize advisor expertise on complex cases that truly require human judgment
•	Establish clear metrics and monitoring for automated responses
•	Create seamless user experience regardless of whether responses are automated or human-reviewed4
Gap Analysis
To achieve our vision, we need to address several key gaps:
1.	Routing Logic: The current categorization framework provides guidance to advisors but doesn't route queries
2.	Automation Criteria: We lack precise definitions and thresholds for "self-service" vs. "complex" queries
3.	Confidence Evaluation: No mechanism exists to assess LLM response confidence for safe automation
4.	User Experience: The interface needs adaptation to support both automated and human responses
5.	Monitoring System: Enhanced tracking and intervention processes are needed for automated responses

Technical Solution Design
Agentic RAG Implementation
We recommend implementing an agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture to enhance both query categorization and response generation. This approach is particularly well-suited for our use case because:
1.	Dynamic Tool Retrieval: Agents can retrieve relevant tools based on query context, adjusting actions to meet specific compliance requirements2
2.	Query Planning: Agents analyze queries and select suitable tools from a predefined set, optimizing outcomes based on query needs2
3.	Knowledge Base Management: Agents select relevant data sources for each query type2
4.	Continuous Learning: The system adapts based on feedback and performance2
The proposed architecture includes:
1. Query Understanding and Decomposition Agent
•	Analyzes incoming queries
•	Identifies query intent and topic
•	Breaks down complex queries into manageable components
•	Flags queries requiring external system access2
2. Routing Agent
•	Determines whether a query can be self-serviced or requires human review
•	Applies defined criteria for complexity, approval requirements, etc.
•	Routes the query accordingly2
3. Information Retrieval Agent
•	Selects optimal knowledge sources based on query type
•	Implements appropriate retrieval strategies
•	Ensures comprehensive information gathering2
4. Response Generation Agent
•	Creates clear, accurate responses using retrieved information
•	Includes confidence scoring for automated decision-making
•	Tags potential areas of uncertainty2
5. Monitoring and Feedback Agent
•	Tracks system performance
•	Collects user feedback
•	Identifies improvement opportunities
•	Flags concerning patterns24
Self-Service Implementation
For queries classified as "self-service," the system will:
1.	Generate responses using the LLM with retrieved context
2.	Apply confidence scoring to ensure quality
3.	Include appropriate disclaimers and compliance language
4.	Deliver directly to users without human review
5.	Offer users an option to request human review if needed34
This creates an effective compliance chatbot experience for straightforward queries while maintaining compliance standards.

Conclusion
The evolution of our compliance query platform toward intelligent automation represents a significant advancement in our compliance management capabilities. By implementing an agentic RAG approach that intelligently determines which queries can be safely automated, we can deliver faster responses to users while allowing our human advisors to focus their expertise where it's most valuable.
This strategic initiative aligns with industry trends toward self-service automation, which has been shown to improve operational efficiency, user satisfaction, and overall compliance effectiveness across various sectors4. With careful implementation and ongoing monitoring, we can achieve the dual objectives of improved efficiency and maintained compliance standards.
