Background: Operational Risk Resilience (ORR) Query Management
Current State of ORR Query Handling
Operational Risk Resilience (ORR) currently utilizes a chatbot named ORRA to manage user queries. This chatbot is built on legacy dialogue flow technology, which functions similarly to a basic If-Then-Else logic.
A key characteristic of user interaction with ORRA is the nature of the queries. A significant number of users submit very short queries, typically 4-5 words in length, effectively using the chatbot as a simple search tool rather than for complex conversational interactions.
System Limitations and User Behavior
The ORRA chatbot operates without a human-in-the-loop (HITL), meaning it is fully automated and cannot escalate complex issues to a human agent in real-time. While this is sufficient for the simple, search-like queries it typically receives, more complex queries related to ORR are directed through email. This indicates a bifurcation in the current process, where simple queries are handled by the chatbot and complex ones are managed manually offline.
Strategic Direction and Proposed Evolution
As part of a broader Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) strategy, there is a clear intention to enhance digital assistance for query management. The long-term vision includes piloting the Resilience Risk policies through a new, more advanced Large Language Model (LLM) tool named ADA.
Onboarding ORR to the ASK platform is the next logical step in this strategic evolution. This move aims to centralize query management and leverage the more sophisticated capabilities of ASK, paving the way for the future integration of advanced AI tools like ADA. This transition will help bridge the gap between handling simple, automated queries and managing complex user requests more efficiently.
