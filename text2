**MEMORANDUM OF MEETING**  

**To:** All Meeting Attendees  
**From:** [Your Name], Senior AI Architect  
**Date:** 26 June 2025  
**Subject:** MOM - Technical Sync on Qsense Deployment, CMLP Integration & Refactoring Status  

---

### **Executive Summary**  
This meeting addressed critical technical dependencies for Qsense production deployment, CMLP monitoring data ingestion, and the status of Qsense/Oradar code refactoring. Key outcomes include confirmation of GitHub-managed configurations, incremental CMLP data ingestion strategy, and a pending timeline for refactoring completion contingent on CI/CD pipeline readiness.  

---

### **Key Discussion Points & Decisions**  

#### **1. Qsense Keyword List Access (Post-Deployment)**  
- **Solution:**  
  The keyword list and all ancillary configurations reside in the **Orchestration Layer GitHub Repo**.  
- **Production Protocol:**  
  Only the **final committed version** of the repo will be deployed to production.  
- **Action:**  
  Analytics team to coordinate with RCDP for repository access and version-tracking procedures.  

#### **2. CMLP Model Monitoring Data Ingestion**  
- **Ingestion Strategy:**  
  Data will flow incrementally to CMLP. Each update cycle appends **only new data**; historical data remains immutable even if source updates occur.  
- **Rationale:**  
  Ensures auditability, reduces storage overhead, and aligns with idempotent ETL design principles.  
- **Next Step:**  
  RCDP to share schema specifications and incremental load frequency with Analytics team by **30 June 2025**.  

#### **3. Qsense & Oradar Code Refactoring Status**  
- **Current State:**  
  - Refactoring completed in RCDP’s local environment.  
  - **Blockers:**  
    - Con-AI IT team must finalize **CI/CD pipeline creation**.  
    - Pending integration and testing of APIs post-pipeline setup.  
- **Timeline Commitment:**  
  Wright (RCDP) to provide a **tentative completion timeline** by **28 June 2025**, contingent on Con-AI IT’s delivery.
