Discussion PointsIntegration of Azure Service for PII:Introduced the inbuilt Azure service designed to manage PII across the platformModeration results will be processed at the platform level for consistencyInterpretation and threshold settings assigned to the "we-core" level (likely a core system or team)Agreed not to send data directly to a Large Language Model (LLM) regardless of moderation statusNo explanations will be provided for outcomes with low confidence or "sail break" scores of 1 or 2Audit logs will be securely stored within the Azure service for compliance and traceabilityContent Moderation Categorization:Proposed a three-tier categorization for moderation results: High, Medium, and LowThresholds for each tier adjustable by use case administrators to ensure flexibilityOverall score determined by the maximum value across moderation services (e.g., Harmful: 0-7, PII: 0%-100%, Jailbreak: TRUE/FALSE)Example: High (Harmful: 4-7, PII: â‰¥95%, Jailbreak: TRUE)Example: Medium (Harmful: 2-3, PII: 69%-94%)Example: Low (Harmful: 0-1, PII: <69%, Jailbreak: FALSE)Control Configurations by Use Case:Controls customizable based on user requirements and aligned with overall scoresHigh Score Controls:Options: Direct LLM processing, selective processing with user confirmation, or no LLM processingMedium Score Controls:Options: Display warning messages with explanations, prompt user confirmation, or show no messagesLow Score Controls:Options: Send email notifications to business leads, log queries with moderation results, block user accounts, classify documents (Internal, Restricted, Highly Restricted)Use Case-Specific Requirements for ADA:Defined requirements for the ADA system across High, Medium, and Low prioritiesHigh Priority:Query processing (direct, selective with confirmation, or no LLM)Alert messages (warnings, confirmations, or none)Audit logs (email notifications, query logging)User management (account blocking)Data integrity (document classification: Internal, Restricted, Highly Restricted)Medium and Low Priorities:Similar options as High priority, with varying implementation urgencyUser Journeys for PII Detection:High Overall Score Journey:User inputs prompt or uploads attachments via UIPII detection triggered using Azure PII, Gemini, or GPT moderationIf PII detected: Alert displayed, LLM processing disabled, reviewer notifiedIf no PII: Request sent to LLM, user receives responseAudit, monitoring, and control summary recordedMedium Overall Score Journey (Selective Processing):User inputs prompt or uploads attachments via UIPII detection triggered using Azure PII and Gemini APIIf PII detected: Alert highlights PII, user forced to edit inputIf no PII: Input sent to reviewer for validationPost-review: If no PII, LLM generates response and sends it to userAutomated monitoring and controls applied throughout
