Of course! Based on the goals you've listed in the Notepad file and the fields in the HSBC development plan form, here is some suggested text you can use. I have created a detailed entry for each of your two goals.
You can adapt or copy and paste these as you see fit.

Goal 2: Understanding of Agile Framework
 * Action Item:
   Gain a comprehensive understanding of the Agile framework, including the roles of Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Project Management.
 * Development Actions to be Taken:
   Enroll in and complete a foundational Agile and Scrum course (e.g., via internal L&D portals or a recognized external provider like Scrum.org). Read key texts such as the official Scrum Guide to understand the principles and theory. Shadow an existing Scrum Master and Product Owner to observe their roles in practice during key ceremonies (sprint planning, daily stand-up, retrospective). I will seek opportunities to take a more active role in my team's Agile processes.
 * Measures of Success:
   * Successfully obtaining a recognized Agile/Scrum certification (e.g., Professional Scrum Master I - PSM I) or completing an internal HSBC equivalent.
   * Ability to clearly articulate the principles of the Agile manifesto, the Scrum framework, and the distinct responsibilities of the Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team.

 * Purpose of Goal:
   To improve my understanding of the project delivery lifecycle and enhance collaboration with team members in an Agile environment. A deeper knowledge of these frameworks will allow me to contribute more effectively to team efficiency, reduce friction in development cycles, and improve project outcomes. This skill set is foundational for career growth within modern technology and project management roles at HSBC.
