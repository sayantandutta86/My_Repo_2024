Enrichment (Focus on Enhancing the Quality of the Query)
1. Objective
The primary objective of the Query Enrichment process, specifically the enhancement step, is to transform raw user queries into well-framed, contextually rich, and unambiguous queries that enable Gen-AI systems to generate accurate, relevant, and high-quality responses. This aligns with the key objectives in the image:
To provide a level of confidence associated with Gen-AI responses.

To ensure the quality of AI-generated responses by leveraging available context (Osense) and resolving nuances (Cradar).
2. Scope
The enhancement part of Query Enrichment focuses on refining the query to ensure it is:
Clear and unambiguous.

Contextually enriched with relevant details.

Structured to minimize complexity and maximize relevancy for Gen-AI processing.
This step prepares the query for subsequent tagging processes (Osense, Cradar, and Confidence Tagging) to ensure the Gen-AI system can interpret and respond effectively.
3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Query Reframing and Clarification
Requirement: The system must analyze the raw query to identify vague, ambiguous, or incomplete phrasing and reframe it into a clear and precise question or statement.
Example: A raw query like "Tell me about space" should be reframed as "Provide an overview of space exploration history and current developments."
Purpose: To reduce misinterpretation by the Gen-AI system and ensure the query aligns with the userâ€™s intent.
