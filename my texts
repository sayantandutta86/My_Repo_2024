Okay, here is a point-by-point summary of the EU regulatory landscape for developing chatbots in the banking compliance space:
 * No Single Dedicated Act: There isn't one specific EU law solely for "chatbots in banking compliance." Compliance involves adhering to several regulations.
 * EU AI Act (Upcoming): This is the main horizontal regulation for AI.
   * It uses a risk-based approach (Unacceptable, High, Limited, Minimal Risk).
   * Chatbots in banking compliance could be classified as High-Risk if they influence access to financial services (e.g., creditworthiness assessment) or are used in critical compliance functions.
   * High-Risk classification imposes strict rules on data, documentation, oversight, robustness, and security before deployment.
   * If purely informational, they might be Limited Risk, mainly requiring transparency (users must know it's AI).
   * The Act is agreed upon and will enter into force in phases over the next few years.
 * GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation - Existing & Crucial):
   * Applies because chatbots process personal data (customer details, queries).
   * Requires lawful basis for processing, transparency, data security, data minimization, and upholding user rights (access, deletion, etc.).
 * DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act - Applicable since Jan 2025):
   * Sets requirements for ICT risk management, cybersecurity, incident reporting, and resilience testing for financial institutions.
   * Covers the chatbot's underlying technology, operational risks, and risks associated with third-party AI providers.
 * Specific Financial Regulations (Existing):
   * MiFID II/MiFIR: Apply if the chatbot provides investment advice or information (rules on suitability, appropriateness, transparency).
   * AML/CFT Directives: Apply if the chatbot is involved in Know Your Customer (KYC), customer onboarding, or transaction monitoring.
   * PSD2: Applies if the chatbot facilitates payments or accesses account data (rules on Strong Customer Authentication - SCA).
 * EBA/ESMA Guidelines (Existing):
   * The European Banking Authority (EBA) and European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) issue guidelines on relevant topics like ICT risk, outsourcing, and internal governance which influence how banks must implement and manage technologies like chatbots.
In essence, developing compliant banking chatbots in the EU requires meeting the upcoming AI-specific rules of the AI Act, robust data protection under GDPR, operational resilience under DORA, and adherence to existing financial sector regulations relevant to the chatbot's specific function.
