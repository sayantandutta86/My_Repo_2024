Subject: Overview of QRadar Query Classification Framework and Its Business Value

Dear [Stakeholder Name],

I hope you’re doing well. As discussed, I’m sharing an overview of QRadar, the query classification framework we use to determine the complexity of incoming business queries and assess when GenAI can autonomously respond versus when human intervention is required.

🔹 Purpose of QRadar

QRadar is designed to analyze and categorize queries based on their intent and sensitivity. This helps ensure that sensitive or complex queries are flagged for manual review, while simpler ones are handled efficiently by GenAI.
By doing so, it helps maintain response quality, risk control, and operational efficiency.

🔹 How QRadar Works

QRadar evaluates each query using two key objectives:

Obj-1: The query seeks approval, permission, or clearance

Obj-2: The query contains references outside GenAI’s available knowledge base, such as attachments, external links, or specific identifiers (e.g., breach IDs, employee numbers)


Based on these objectives, QRadar classifies queries into three levels of complexity:

1. High Complexity

Criteria: Query fulfills Obj-1 or Obj-2 and is related to sensitive scenarios (e.g., breaches, security alerts, compliance incidents)

Action: Requires manual review due to sensitivity and potential risk

Synthetic Example:

> “A team member received a notification about a potential compliance breach (ECBM-134700). Could you confirm the reason and next steps?”




2. Medium Complexity

Criteria: Query fulfills Obj-1 or Obj-2, but not related to sensitive scenarios

Action: May need review or confirmation by an advisor before finalizing

Synthetic Examples:

Obj-1 example:

> “Requesting clearance to onboard a third-party consultant for a short-term analytics project.”



Obj-2 example (external reference):

> “Please refer to the attached quarterly report and confirm if the disclosed data aligns with the latest compliance requirements.”



(This query references external attachments that GenAI cannot interpret, hence advisor review is required.)



3. Low Complexity

Criteria: Query does not fulfill Obj-1 or Obj-2 — typically informational or advisory in nature

Action: Can be safely answered by GenAI with minimal oversight

Synthetic Example:

> “Where can I find the latest version of the data privacy policy?”

🔹 Business Value of QRadar

Implementing QRadar can deliver measurable benefits:

✅ Risk Mitigation: Ensures sensitive or high-stakes queries are escalated to human advisors

✅ Efficiency: Allows GenAI to handle routine questions automatically

✅ Accuracy: Improves overall response quality by routing complex queries appropriately

✅ Governance: Strengthens auditability and oversight in decision-making

✅ Scalability: Enables consistent handling of high query volumes

🔹 Recommendation

Given these advantages, QRadar can be a valuable addition to your business query management process. It provides a structured approach to triaging and routing queries, balancing automation with control, and ensuring compliance and accuracy.

I’d be happy to walk you through a demo or discuss how this can be tailored for your specific business needs.
