Intelligent Query Routing – Shadow Pilot Proposal

Background: Current ADA shows confidence (red/amber/green) for AI responses; advisors finalize. Next step is to auto-route simple STP queries vs human-needed queries.

Experiment: 310 compliance queries (June 2025) labelled with few-shot prompting (10 automatable + 10 human examples).

Validation: 60 queries (~20%) team-verified → Automatable labels consistently accurate; human-required labels had expected debatable cases.

Value: Enables safe automation of simple queries → faster turnaround, reduced advisor workload, clear FTE/time savings.

Next Steps: Run in shadow mode on production ADA for 4–6 weeks, gather advisor feedback, fine-tune thresholds, then propose future implementation.
