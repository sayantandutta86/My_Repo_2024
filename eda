Description:
This section provides a comprehensive,step-by-step account of the processes and transformations applied to the raw data to construct the final dataset used for model training and testing. It moves beyond assessing data quality (Section 5.5) to document the active engineering and structuring of the data. The purpose is to ensure the entire data preparation pipeline is transparent, reproducible, and well-understood. This is critical for diagnosing issues, rebuilding the dataset, and onboarding new team members.

Expected Outcome:
A clear,sequential narrative that allows a reader to exactly replicate the process of creating the modeling dataset from the original sources. The outcome is not just a cleaned dataset, but a documented recipe for creating it. This should include:

1. Data Integration & Joining Logic: A description of how multiple raw data tables or sources were combined.
   · Example: "The customer demographic table was left-joined to the transaction summary table on the unique customer ID key. Records without a matching ID were excluded as they represented inactive accounts."
   · Expected Artifact: SQL query snippets, code showing merge operations, or a diagram illustrating the data integration flow.
2. Feature Engineering & Creation: Documentation of any new variables (features) that were created from existing raw variables.
   · Example: "A new feature, days_since_last_purchase, was calculated from the last_purchase_date field. The raw text from product_description was used to create binary flags for key product categories."
   · Expected Artifact: A list of derived features with their formulas or creation logic.
3. Final Feature Set Definition: A clear definition of the exact set of variables that were fed into the model. This is the output of any feature selection processes.
   · Example: "Following correlation analysis and feature importance ranking, the final model feature set contained 15 variables from the original 45."
   · Expected Artifact: A list of the final feature names. This can be a reference to a more detailed table in Section 6.1 (Model Variables).
4. Target Variable Construction: A precise explanation of how the model's target (or outcome) variable was defined and derived.
   · Example: "The binary target variable is_churner was defined as a customer with no login activity for 90 consecutive days. This was derived from the user_activity_log table."
5. Dataset Splitting Strategy: A description of how the final prepared dataset was partitioned for model development and validation (e.g., into training, testing, and validation/holdout sets).
   · Example: "The data was split chronologically into a training set (Jan 2020 - Dec 2022), a test set (Jan 2023 - Jun 2023), and a holdout set (Jul 2023 - Dec 2023) to evaluate temporal robustness."
   · Expected Artifact: Statement of the split ratio/method and the rationale for choosing it (e.g., random split, time-based split).

In essence, Section 5.6 answers the question: "From the raw data in Section 5.1, what specific steps did you take to create the clean, curated dataset that was actually used to train the model in Section 6?" The outcome is a reproducible data pipeline blueprint.
