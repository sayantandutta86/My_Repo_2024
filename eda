User Story 2 – of Epic 1: Query Attachment Object Extraction

Description:
As a system admin, I want to enable secure extraction and transmission of ASK query attachment metadata and objects from the Appian server to the RCDP platform, so that downstream ADA pipelines can process and analyze attachment data for compliance-related insights.

Acceptance Criteria (AC):

AC1: The Appian service should extract both attachment metadata (e.g., file name, type, size, upload timestamp, query reference) and the binary object from user-submitted queries.

AC2: The extracted data and objects should be securely transmitted to the RCDP landing zone via an approved integration channel (e.g., SFTP, API, or message queue) with proper encryption and logging.

AC3: Each transmission should include unique identifiers linking the attachment to its parent query record in Appian.

AC4: The RCDP should acknowledge receipt and validation of each attachment object and metadata entry.

AC5: In case of transmission failure or mismatch, retry and error-handling mechanisms must be implemented and logged for audit purposes.


Notes:

This story focuses on the data flow and integration between Appian and RCDP for attachment-level details.

Downstream processing or enrichment in RCDP (e.g., metadata parsing, AI-based classification) will be handled in subsequent user stories.

Would you like me to also draft sub-tasks (2.1.1, 2.1.2) under this user story — for example, one for metadata extraction and another for object transfer implementation?
