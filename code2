Minutes of Meeting (MOM) – RSR Query Validation (SIT Testing)

A total of 25 RSR queries were used for end-to-end SIT testing to validate data flow across RCDP and CMLP.

2 queries were identified as not part of the actual test data; hence, validation applies to 23 queries.

RCDP has confirmed that all 23 queries were successfully received at their end.

At the CMLP end, 16 queries have been received to date, with 7 queries pending ingestion.

Analytics team will revalidate the CMLP ingestion status on 15th October and share the final update.

If the discrepancy persists, an issue will be formally raised for resolution.

Would you like me to make it email-ready (with subject line, recipient note, and closing line like “Regards, Sayantan”)?
