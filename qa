Slide 2: The Challenge: QA Bottleneck in "Ask Compliance"
 * Headline: Current QA Process: Effective but Resource-Intensive
 * Content:
   * Brief overview of the "Ask Compliance" flow: User Query -> LLM Draft -> Advisor Edit -> Manager QA.
   * Manager QA is crucial for ensuring advice quality and compliance adherence.
   * The Problem: Line managers manually review every advisor response, including routine, low-complexity queries.
   * Impact:
     * Significant manager time consumed by reviews.
     * Limited capacity for managers to focus on high-risk, complex advice scenarios.
     * Suboptimal allocation of expert compliance resources.
 * Visual: Simple flowchart of the current process, highlighting the "Manager QA" step as a bottleneck consuming significant time.
 * Takeaway: Our current QA process, while vital, creates an efficiency bottleneck for our experienced line managers.
Slide 3: The Opportunity: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs)
 * Headline: LLMs Can Intelligently Assist with QA Evaluation
 * Content:
   * What are LLMs? AI systems capable of understanding, analyzing, and evaluating text based on instructions.
   * Relevant Capabilities for QA:
     * Assessing text clarity and understandability.
     * Checking for the presence of required elements (e.g., rationale, specific actions, risk warnings).
     * Comparing dates for timeliness checks.
   * The Opportunity: Use LLMs as an intelligent assistant to perform preliminary checks against objective QA criteria, freeing up manager time.
 * Visual: Icon representing AI/LLM analyzing a document or checklist. Maybe a "before vs. after" showing manager workload distribution.
 * Takeaway: LLM technology offers capabilities well-suited to assist with specific, objective aspects of our QA checklist.
Slide 4: Proposed Solution: LLM-Assisted QA Framework
 * Headline: A "Human-in-the-Loop" Approach to Smarter QA
 * Content:
   * Concept: Integrate an LLM QA check before the line manager review for Low and Medium complexity queries.
   * How it Works:
     * Advisor submits response.
     * System checks query complexity.
     * If Low/Medium, LLM assesses response against predefined QA criteria (see next slide).
     * LLM generates a QA assessment report (Pass/Fail/N/A + Reasoning) for the manager.
     * Response enters manager queue, flagged based on LLM assessment.
   * Crucially: The Line Manager always retains full oversight, final decision-making authority, and the ability to override the LLM.The LLM assists, it does not replace.
 * Visual: Clear flowchart illustrating the proposed workflow (Advisor Submit -> Complexity Check -> LLM QA (Low/Med) -> Manager Review Queue (Flagged vs. Approved) -> Final Manager QA Decision).
 * Takeaway: We propose an LLM assistant that flags potential issues and helps prioritize manager attention, keeping humans firmly in control.
Slide 5: Which QA Checks Can the LLM Assist With?
 * Headline: Focusing LLM Assistance on Objective & Text-Based Criteria
 * Content: Based on feasibility analysis, the LLM is best suited to assist with:
   * High Feasibility (Good for LLM):
     * Clarity: Is the advice understandable? Does it explain HOW to comply?
     * Action: Are clear actions and timeframes specified (if applicable)?
     * Closure Timeliness: Was the query closed within expected timeframes (using metadata)?
   * Medium Feasibility (LLM checks presence/basic relevance):
     * Rationale: Is a justification (the WHY) present?
     * Consequences: Are risks/consequences mentioned?
   * Low Feasibility (Remains Fully Manual): Checks requiring deep subjective judgment, external context, or sensitive data interpretation (e.g., Appropriateness of Follow-up/System Use, Data Sensitivity Handling).
 * Visual: Simplified table or checklist graphic showing which criteria are targeted for LLM assistance vs. those remaining manual.
 * Takeaway: The LLM will handle checks focused on the advice text itself, leaving complex judgments and sensitive data checks to managers.
Slide 6: Ensuring Accuracy: Validation with Historical Data
 * Headline: Rigorous Testing Using Our Own Data Before Deployment
 * Content:
   * Validation Plan: We will simulate the LLM QA process using 3 years of historical "Ask Compliance" data.
   * Methodology:
     * Input historical queries and advisor responses into the LLM QA system.
     * Compare the LLM's automated QA assessment (Pass/Fail for each criterion) against the actual QA results recorded by line managers for thousands of cases.
   * Metrics: We will measure Accuracy, Precision (reliability of LLM 'Fail' flags), and Recall (LLM's ability to catch actual issues).
   * Outcome: This provides empirical evidence of performance, allows us to fine-tune the LLM's instructions (prompts), and builds confidence before live deployment. We will share illustrative examples from this simulation.
 * Visual: Diagram: [Historical Data] -> <-> ->.
 * Takeaway: We will rigorously test the LLM's accuracy against past human reviews using our own data to ensure reliability.
Slide 7: How It Looks: Workflow Integration & Manager View
 * Headline: Seamless Integration into the Manager's Daily Workflow
 * Content:
   * Workflow: The LLM step fits between advisor submission and manager review for applicable queries.
   * Manager Experience:
     * QA queue will clearly differentiate items flagged by the LLM ('Requires Review') from those assessed as likely compliant ('LLM Approved').
     * When reviewing a case, the manager will see the LLM's assessment (Pass/Fail/N/A) and its reasoning directly within their existing QA interface.
     * Simple one-click override of LLM assessment.
     * Mechanism to provide quick feedback on LLM accuracy for continuous improvement.
 * Visual: Mock-up screenshot of the QA queue (showing flagged/approved items) and the QA review screen (showing integrated LLM assessment and reasoning).
 * Takeaway: The LLM assistance will be integrated smoothly into existing tools, providing clear, actionable information to managers without adding complexity.
Slide 8: Measuring Success: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
 * Headline: Tracking the Impact: Driving Efficiency While Maintaining Quality
 * Content: We will measure success using clear KPIs:
   * Efficiency Gains:
     * Reduction in Average Manager Review Time (especially for 'LLM Approved' cases).
     * Increase in Manager QA Throughput (Queries reviewed per period).
   * Effectiveness & Quality:
     * LLM Accuracy Rate (Agreement with final manager decision).
     * QA Consistency (Reduced variability in applying objective criteria).
     * Manager Override Rate (Monitoring reliance and LLM performance).
   * Goal: Quantify the time savings and efficiency improvements while ensuring QA quality remains high or improves.
 * Visual: Simple dashboard graphic showing target improvements for 1-2 key KPIs (e.g., bar chart: Avg. Review Time - Before vs. After LLM Assist).
 * Takeaway: Success will be measured by tangible improvements in efficiency and capacity, backed by data confirming quality is maintained.
Slide 9: Addressing Concerns: Risk Management & Mitigation
 * Headline: Proactively Managing Potential Risks
 * Content: We've identified key risks and have mitigation strategies:
   * Risk: LLM Errors / Inaccuracy
     * Mitigation: Human-in-the-Loop (Manager Final Say), rigorous validation, continuous monitoring, focus on objective criteria.
   * Risk: Manager Over-Reliance / Complacency
     * Mitigation: Clear training on LLM's role (assistant, not decider), monitoring override rates, random spot-checks of 'LLM Approved' cases.
   * Risk: Data Privacy & Security
     * Mitigation: Use secure, bank-approved LLM infrastructure (on-premise/private cloud preferred), data minimization, adherence to all bank security protocols.
   * Risk: Regulatory Compliance (AI Governance)
     * Mitigation: Human oversight is key, alignment with Model Risk Management frameworks, robust documentation, transparency (LLM reasoning provided), adherence to FINRA/OCC guidance on AI use.
 * Visual: Four quadrants or icons representing the key risk categories (Accuracy, Reliance, Data, Regulatory) with brief mitigation points.
 * Takeaway: We have a clear plan to manage risks, ensuring human control, data security, and regulatory alignment remain paramount.
Slide 10: The Path Forward: Implementation Roadmap
 * Headline: Phased Approach for Controlled Rollout & Learning
 * Content: We propose a 3-phase implementation:
   * Phase 1: Pilot (1-2 Months)
     * Scope: Small group of managers, limited query types (Low complexity), core feasible criteria.
     * Goal: Validate usability, gather feedback, refine prompts, confirm initial impact.
   * Phase 2: Phased Rollout (3-6 Months)
     * Scope: Gradually expand users, include Medium complexity queries, potentially add more criteria.
     * Goal: Scale methodically, demonstrate value via KPIs, manage change effectively.
   * Phase 3: Full Implementation & Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)
     * Scope: Standard operating procedure for all target managers/queries.
     * Goal: Steady-state operation, ongoing monitoring, governance, continuous refinement based on feedback and performance data.
 * Visual: Simple timeline graphic showing the three phases with key activities/goals for each.
 * Takeaway: We will implement this carefully, starting with a pilot to learn and adapt, ensuring a smooth and successful rollout.
