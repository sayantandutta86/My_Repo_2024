The Model Acceptance Criteria for the Ask Digital Assistant (ADA) have been defined in alignment with business expectations and stakeholder objectives, and will form the basis for sign-off by the Product Owner following successful pilot validation.
The acceptance framework focuses on assessing ADA’s ability to deliver measurable operational improvements, enhance user experience, and demonstrate readiness for controlled production deployment.

1. Business Performance and Efficiency

The ADA model should demonstrate tangible improvement in the efficiency of the advisory process by:

Reducing turnaround time (TAT): measurable decrease in the time Risk Stewards spend locating, reviewing, and consolidating relevant policy information before formulating responses.

Enhancing productivity: enabling stewards to focus on higher-complexity or judgment-based queries by automating routine information retrieval and draft preparation.

Improving process consistency: providing standardized and structured draft responses that align with policy references, thereby reducing variation across advisors and regions.


A demonstrated measurable improvement in these areas, as observed through comparative pilot metrics and feedback, will constitute successful achievement of this criterion.

2. Usefulness and Quality of AI Outputs

The usefulness, accuracy, and contextual quality of AI-generated suggested responses will be evaluated through structured feedback collected directly from Risk Stewards during pilot usage.
Feedback will be assessed across the following dimensions:

Relevance: response content accurately reflects the intent and context of the user query.

Completeness: draft response contains appropriate policy references and sufficient coverage of the query.

Clarity and usability: response is coherent, logically structured, and easily reviewable for final submission.


Positive steward feedback, indicating that ADA assists in faster, more confident, and policy-aligned response preparation, will be considered confirmation of business value realization.

3. Acceptance and Sign-Off

The ADA model will be deemed accepted once:

Business users (Risk Stewards) validate that ADA outputs consistently aid response drafting without compromising accuracy or interpretability.

The Product Owner confirms that efficiency gains and user satisfaction meet expected benchmarks for pilot success.

No material process, data quality, or usability concerns remain outstanding from the pilot evaluation.


Upon meeting these conditions, the ADA model will be formally signed off for controlled production expansion within the Ask Compliance platform.

Summary

Successful validation under these acceptance criteria—demonstrated efficiency improvement, positive user evaluation, and confirmed business benefit—will signify that the ADA model meets its intended purpose and is suitable for scaled deployment under continued governance oversight.
