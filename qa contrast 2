Here is an analysis of the contrasting QA metric outcomes between the Human Reviewer and AQUA, with arguments for why AQUA's verdict is correct based on the provided documentation.
Example 1
Metric: Clarity
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: Pass
 * AQUA Verdict: Fail
Argument: AQUA's "Fail" verdict for Clarity is more accurate. The query from the user asks for "advice in order to go ahead with the transaction" regarding a landlord with "Potential alerts" from a screening. The response, however, does not provide this advice. Instead, it redirects the user to other teams. According to the metric definition, Clarity assesses if "the advice being provided [is] clear and easy to understand such that the recipient will be able to understand HOW they can comply with the advice". Since the response does not contain the requested advice on how to proceed with the transaction, it fails the clarity metric. The human reviewer's note that "The advice was correctly directed to the appropriate ones to respond" assesses the correctness of the redirection, not the clarity of the advice on the user's actual query.
Metric: Rationale
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: Pass
 * AQUA Verdict: Fail
Argument: AQUA's "Fail" verdict for Rationale is justified. The metric for Rationale asks, "Is there a clear and justifiable rationale for the advice that has been provided". The response advises redirecting the query to specific teams in India but offers no explanation as to why those teams are the appropriate contacts or why the current advisor cannot handle the request. The human reviewer's note, "Information was provided to direct the query," simply acknowledges the redirection itself, not the reasoning behind it. Therefore, a clear rationale is absent, validating AQUA's verdict.
Example 2
Metric: Clarity
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: Pass
 * AQUA Verdict: Fail
Argument: AQUA's "Fail" verdict for Clarity is more aligned with the provided evidence. While the human reviewer notes that the recipient would likely understand the context due to a prior call, they also state that the "context of the original issue and tactical solution options proposed has not been included" and it is "not a complete audit trail and it makes it difficult to follow the advice". This admission of difficulty in following the advice directly supports AQUA's "Fail" verdict, as the advice is not clear on its own within the system of record.
Metric: Action
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: Pass
 * AQUA Verdict: n/a
Argument: AQUA's "n/a" verdict for Action is more appropriate. The Action metric definition looks for "a clear action for the recipient to take (if applicable)? Is there a clearly identified timeframe". The response outlines points that were discussed and need to be considered in a future proposal, but it does not explicitly direct the recipient to perform a specific action within a timeframe. The author of the response even states, "I appreciate that you are planning on drafting/circulating updated proposals", indicating the action is anticipated but not being directly assigned in this communication. The human reviewer's interpretation that the points are "positioned as actions/requirements" is a subjective take, whereas AQUA correctly identifies that no direct action was given to the recipient.
Example 3
Metric: Clarity
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: Pass
 * AQUA Verdict: Fail
Argument: AQUA's "Fail" verdict for Clarity is correct. The user's query asks for confirmation on whether a proposed payment arrangement "will be allowed/authorised" and if it "work[s] for HSBC?". The response does not directly answer this. It raises a concern about the role of a third party and then instructs the user to have the customer complete an SEQ and escalate the case. It does not provide clarity on how to get the transaction authorized, which was the core of the query. The metric for Clarity requires the advice to explain "HOW they can comply with the advice". Without a clear "yes" or "no" and the steps for compliance, the response lacks clarity.
Metric: Consequences/Risks
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: n/a
 * AQUA Verdict: Fail
Argument: AQUA's "Fail" verdict for Consequences/Risks is more accurate. The response advises that the "customer still have direct exposure to Russia" and "will have to ring fence their exposure away from HSBC". This implies a significant risk. The Consequences/Risks metric asks if "the advice clearly highlighted the consequences or risks of NOT following the requirements specified". By not explicitly stating the consequences of failing to ring-fence the exposure (e.g., account closure, transaction blocking), the response fails to meet this requirement. The human reviewer's "n/a" suggests they did not see a need to mention risks, which is an oversight given the context.
Example 4
Metric: Clarity
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: Pass
 * AQUA Verdict: Fail
Argument: AQUA's "Fail" verdict for Clarity is justified. The response states that a sanctions concern was discounted and advises to "Please close this query accordingly". However, the original query also asked the advisor to "Please make customer aware of this and provide him with a copy of the external sanctions policy" and to escalate if there are other concerns. The response provides no guidance on these parts of the request, making the advice on how to proceed with closing the entire query unclear.
Metric: Action
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: n/a
 * AQUA Verdict: Pass
Argument: AQUA's "Pass" verdict for Action is correct. The response contains the explicit instruction: "Please close this query accordingly." This is a clear action for the recipient to take, fitting the metric's definition of "a clear action for the recipient to take". The human reviewer's "n/a" verdict is incorrect as a direct action was clearly stated.
Example 5
Metric: Clarity
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: n/a
 * AQUA Verdict: Fail
Argument: AQUA's "Fail" verdict for Clarity is correct. The client's query is specific: "is it possible to process this payment through HSBC on HSBCnet and, if so, do they need to provide any further details?". The response does not answer this question. Instead, it states that a "sanctions review [has been] triggered" and that the case will be closed. This fails to provide the user with the clear information they requested on how to proceed, thus failing the Clarity metric. The human reviewer's "n/a" is inappropriate as the core of the query was a request for clear advice.
Metric: Rationale
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: n/a
 * AQUA Verdict: Fail
Argument: AQUA's "Fail" for Rationale is accurate. The advisor's response says a sanctions review has been triggered but gives no rationale as to why this specific query necessitated a review. The Rationale metric requires a "clear and justifiable rationale for the advice," which is absent here. The human reviewer's "n/a" overlooks this lack of explanation.
Example 6
Metric: Clarity
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: n/a
 * AQUA Verdict: Pass
Argument: AQUA's "Pass" verdict for Clarity is correct. The response, "Apologies, for some reason the system won't allow me to attached the approved CSRA. I will send it over to you by email instead for your records," is perfectly clear. The recipient understands exactly what will happen next (they will receive the document via email). The human reviewer's "n/a" is incorrect as the communication is clear and sets a clear expectation.
Metric: Rationale
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: n/a
 * AQUA Verdict: Fail
Argument: AQUA's "Fail" verdict for Rationale is justified. While the response is clear, it does not provide a rationale for why the system is not allowing the attachment. While a deep technical explanation isn't needed, the complete absence of any reason for the deviation from the standard process supports a "Fail" on the Rationale metric. The human reviewer's "n/a" is a plausible but less rigorous assessment.
Metric: Action
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: Pass
 * AQUA Verdict: n/a
Argument: AQUA's "n/a" verdict for Action is more accurate. The response informs the recipient of an action the sender will take ("I will send it over to you by email"). It does not, however, require any action from the recipient, Amanda. The Action metric is defined from the perspective of the recipient. Since Amanda is not required to do anything, an "n/a" verdict is appropriate. The human reviewer's "Pass" is incorrect because it misinterprets who is being assigned an action.
Example 7
Metric: Clarity
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: Pass
 * AQUA Verdict: Fail
Argument: AQUA's "Fail" verdict for Clarity is correct. The user asks a direct question: "Does HSBC have any restrictions on international payments to non sanctioned Russian banks?" and "Do you know of any Russian banks That HSBC are able to send money to". The response does not answer these questions, instead stating, "we are unable to provide advice to the Customer in relation to how they can make payments to Russia" and provides a link to a policy document. This does not provide the clarity the user was seeking and fails to explain how the customer can comply, forcing them to interpret a policy document on their own.
Metric: Action
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: Pass
 * AQUA Verdict: n/a
Argument: AQUA's "n/a" verdict for Action is accurate. The response explicitly states, "I cannot provide any further guidance to assist the Customer regarding this matter." No action is assigned to the recipient, Daniel. He is given a link to a policy, but there is no instruction for him to take a specific action. Therefore, "n/a" is the correct verdict. The human reviewer's "Pass" is incorrect as no action was mandated.
Example 8
Metric: Clarity
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: Pass
 * AQUA Verdict: Fail
Argument: AQUA's "Fail" verdict for Clarity is correct. The response simply says, "if you have no further update for the above questions, I would suggest you to close this query." This does not address the original query about whether a payment from "Lukoil Personnel OOD" is allowed. It provides no advice or information, making it impossible for the user to understand how to proceed with their actual problem. It lacks any semblance of clarity on the underlying issue.
Metric: Rationale
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: Pass
 * AQUA Verdict: Fail
Argument: AQUA's "Fail" verdict for Rationale is justified. The response suggests closing the query but provides absolutely no reason why this is the appropriate course of action, especially when the initial question remains unanswered. The lack of any justification for the advice to close the query is a clear failure of the Rationale metric. The human reviewer's "Pass" is inexplicable in this context.
Metric: Action
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: n/a
 * AQUA Verdict: Pass
Argument: AQUA's "Pass" verdict for Action is correct. The response contains a clear, albeit unhelpful, suggestion for an action: "I would suggest you to close this query." This is a direct instruction for the recipient to take an action. The human reviewer's "n/a" is incorrect as a specific action was proposed.
Example 9
Metric: Rationale
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: Fail
 * AQUA Verdict: Pass
Argument: AQUA's "Pass" verdict for Rationale is the more accurate assessment. The response asks for clarification on remedial action because "it would appear that the information presented to FOS was inaccurate." This statement itself provides the rationale for why the query is being made. The reason for the advice (the query) is the potential for inaccurate information having been sent to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS). The human reviewer's "Fail," with the note that the entry doesn't reflect the full trail, is assessing the completeness of the case file rather than the presence of a rationale within this specific response.
Metric: Action
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: Pass
 * AQUA Verdict: Fail
Argument: AQUA's "Fail" verdict for Action is correct. The response asks, "Can you advise how this is being taken forward and who is the lead?". This is a question, a request for information, not an instruction to take a specific action. The recipient is not told what to do, but rather to report on what is being done. The Action metric requires a "clear action for the recipient to take," which is not present here. The human reviewer's "Pass" is based on a misinterpretation of a question as an action.
Metric: Consequences/Risks
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: Pass
 * AQUA Verdict: n/a
Argument: AQUA's "n/a" verdict is more precise. The response highlights a serious issue (inaccurate information to FOS) but does not explicitly state the "consequences or risks of NOT following the requirements specified," because no requirements are specified. It is asking for information. While the human reviewer correctly notes that the points raised are "clearly reflective of the risks/concerns," this is an inference. The response itself does not detail the consequences as required by the metric definition, making "n/a" the most fitting verdict.


Example 10
Metric: Clarity
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: Pass
 * AQUA Verdict: Fail
Argument: AQUA's "Fail" verdict for Clarity is more accurate. The query asks for advice on whether a customer can receive payments from a Russian entity into their HSBC UK account. The response states that HSBC has an internal policy that restricts any exposure to Russia, and on that basis, the proposed activity cannot be supported. While the answer is direct, it fails to provide the user with guidance on how to comply or what the next steps are, if any. The metric for Clarity is to ensure "the recipient will be able to understand HOW they can comply with the advice". The response simply delivers a "no" without any further guidance, which doesn't fully meet the standard for a clear and actionable piece of advice.
Metric: Rationale
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: Pass
 * AQUA Verdict: Fail
Argument: AQUA's "Fail" verdict for Rationale is justified. The response cites an "internal policy" as the reason for not supporting the transaction but fails to provide any details or justification for this policy. The Rationale metric requires a "clear and justifiable rationale for the advice" so the recipient can understand "WHY the advice is appropriate". Merely mentioning the existence of an internal policy without any context or explanation as to why that policy is in place does not constitute a clear or justifiable rationale.
Metric: Action
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: n/a
 * AQUA Verdict: Fail
Argument: AQUA's "Fail" verdict for Action is correct. The response effectively shuts down the query by stating the activity cannot be supported. However, it fails to provide a clear action for the recipient to take, such as how to officially communicate this to the customer or what steps to take to close the inquiry from their end. The Action metric looks for "a clear action for the recipient to take". By providing no direction, the response fails this metric. The human reviewer's "n/a" is less accurate because some form of closing action is implicitly required from the user, and the response offers no guidance for it.
Metric: Consequences/Risks
 * Human Reviewer Verdict: n/a
 * AQUA Verdict: Fail
Argument: AQUA's "Fail" verdict for Consequences/Risks is the more diligent assessment. The response indicates a hard stop on the transaction due to Russian sanctions exposure. The Consequences/Risks metric requires the advice to highlight "the consequences or risks of NOT following the requirements specified". While the requirement is to not proceed, the response fails to explicitly state the risks of attempting to circumvent this advice (e.g., regulatory breaches, account closure, legal penalties). Given the high-risk nature of the query (sanctions), the failure to mention any consequences is a significant omission. The human reviewer's "n/a" overlooks the implied risks that should have been made explicit.
