| ASK ID | Query | Response | QA by reviewer | QA by AQUA | Remarks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASK 122092 | Corporate Services has set up a Central Team who is responsible for screening Landlords/Tenants/Payees globally... A request was received from our UK team... need your advice in order to go ahead with the transaction... Watch person BANCO MONEX S.A. is not matching with our BANCO MONEX SA IBM MONEX GRUPO FIN F 4614... As there are no two data points to discount, hence considered as Potential match. | Dear Kumar,<br><br>Please this query to the Tea that is in India and they can sand this inforinanon to ABSC, Evasion & Reputational risk ABC LAM<br><br>and in cam of identify any conciam refated to Sanctiom they can sand the query to Sanctions: LATAM<br><br>Sanctions La THIRD PARTY | 1. Clarity<br>   Verdict: Pass<br>   Reviewers note: The advice was correctly directed to the appropriate area to respond the request, it was not related to AC<br><br>2. Rationale<br>   Verdict: Pass<br>   Reviewers note: Information wre provided to direct the query | 1. Clarity<br>   Verdict: Fail<br>   Reasoning: The advice lacks clear instructions on how to proceed with the screening issue.<br><br>2. Rationale<br>   Verdict: Fail<br>   Reasoning: No rationale is provided for why the quary should be directed to specific teams. | 1. [cite_start]Clarity<br>   Reviewer verdict: Pass<br>   AI verdict: Fail<br>   Analysis: The reviewer's focus on correct redirection misses the point of the "Clarity" metric, which is whether the recipient understands HOW to comply. The response tells the user who to contact but offers no clear instructions on how to proceed with the landlord screening issue. [cite_start]It doesn't answer the user's request for "advice in order to go ahead", leaving them without a clear path to resolution. AQUA's verdict is correct because the advice is not self-contained and actionable.<br><br>2. Rationale<br>   Reviewer verdict: Pass<br>   AI verdict: Fail<br>   Analysis: The response fails to provide a rationale explaining WHY the query must be redirected to multiple teams. [cite_start]The "Rationale" metric requires that the recipient understand WHY the advice is appropriate. A proper rationale would explain why the current advisor cannot handle the query and why the other teams are the correct owners (e.g., based on geography or risk type). Without this justification, the advice is merely an unsubstantiated redirection, making AQUA's "Fail" verdict correct. |

| Keith,<br><br>following the call this morning, I wanted to formalise input from UK CMB RC... | Keith,<br>Thanks for arranging the call this morning... I wanted to provide RC view in advance of this...<br>1. BBB Communication requirements...<br>2. Controls in introducing a manual process...<br>3. CRA reporting... | 1. Clarity: <br>   Verdict: Fail<br>   Reviewers note: ...context of the original issue... has not been included... not a complete audit trail and makes it difficult to follow the advice<br><br>3. Action<br>   Verdict: Pass<br>   Reviewers note: Yes, advice has been structured such that the points and areas mentioned as action is helpful | 1. Clarity: <br>   Verdict: Pass<br>   AI Reasoning: The response clearly outlines the points discussed and requirements for compliance.<br><br>3. Action<br>   Verdict: n/a<br>   AI Reasoning: No specific action or timeframe is mentioned, only general understanding that proposals will be circulated. | 1. Clarity<br>   Reviewer verdict: Fail<br>   AI verdict: Pass<br>   Analysis: The reviewer incorrectly applies an "audit trail" standard, which is not part of the "Clarity" metric. [cite_start]The metric assesses if the advice is clear to the recipient. [cite_start]Since the query and response both explicitly reference a call the recipient ("Keith") was on, the context is shared. The response then clearly lists the specific points (BBB communications, controls, CRA reporting) to be addressed. For the intended recipient, the advice on HOW to proceed is perfectly clear. AQUA's verdict is correct.<br><br>3. Action<br>   Reviewer verdict: Pass<br>   AI verdict: n/a<br>   Analysis: The reviewer misidentifies the provided points as "actions." [cite_start]The "Action" metric requires a "clear action for the recipient to take". [cite_start]The response is explicitly framed as providing an "RC view in advance" of proposals being drafted by the recipient. It provides inputs for a future action, but does not instruct the recipient to perform a new, distinct task. Therefore, no specific action is being mandated, making AQUA's "n/a" verdict correct. |

| ...client is communicating this stance internally and would like to refer the following example to confirm if it will be allowed/authorised... All payments to entities such as Kennedys are made via RFI Ltd, Jersey... a subsidiary of Rusal... we intend to revert to Rusal advising that we are happy to accept instruction... | ...If the customer is providing services to Rusal in Russia but are being paid by outside Russia via the subsidiary, the customer still have direct exposure to Russia. They will have to complete their SEQ... please ask the customer to complete a SEQ and escalate this case to FC Sanctions in HK... | 1. Clarity: <br>   Verdict: Pass<br><br>4. Consequences/Risks<br>   Verdict: n/a | 1. Clarity<br>   Verdict: Fail<br>   AI Reasoning: The response is not clear about the specific steps needed to comply with the advice.<br><br>4. Consequences/Risks<br>   Verdict: Fail<br>   AI Reasoning: The risks of not following through are implied but not explicitly stated. | 1. [cite_start]Clarity<br>   Reviewer verdict: Pass<br>   AI verdict: Fail<br>   Analysis: The response instructs the user to "complete a SEQ and escalate" but fails the "Clarity" test as it does not explain HOW to do this. It uses unexplained jargon ("SEQ") and does not detail the escalation process. For the advice to be "clear and easy to understand," it should have included instructions on where to find the form and how to perform the escalation. Without this, the advice is incomplete, making AQUA's "Fail" verdict correct.<br><br>4. [cite_start]Consequences/Risks<br>   Reviewer verdict: n/a<br>   AI verdict: Fail<br>   Analysis: The query involves payments linked to a Russian entity (Rusal), which is a high-risk activity where consequences are applicable. [cite_start]The "Consequences/Risks" metric requires the advice to highlight such risks. The response instructs the user to escalate but fails to state the significant risks of not complying (i.e., proceeding with the transaction), such as sanctions violations. The reviewer's "n/a" is incorrect because risks are relevant and unstated. AQUA's "Fail" is correct. |

| Hi Alice, reply to your trigger, the cases in on CRT... Can you review and confirm next steps... Customer confirmed that the Debits... The cash credit... TRIGGER: Payment reference: JK230605-001234 Customer has attempted to remit a payment... with sanctions nexus. Please complete the SEQ with customer... | Hi Mal, apologies for delay in getting back to you.<br><br>As per AS 111087, the alert was discounted by UK Sanctions Advisory... as beneficiary's date of birth differing... there is no further sanctions concern for the alert. Please close this query accordingly. | 3. Action<br>   Verdict: n/a<br><br>1. Clarity: <br>   Verdict: Pass | 1. Clarity: <br>   Verdict: Fail<br>   AI Reasoning: The response lacks clarity on how the recipient should proceed with closing the query.<br><br>3. Action<br>   Verdict: Pass<br>   AI Reasoning: A clear action to close the query is given, although no timeframe is specified. | 1. Clarity<br>   Reviewer verdict: Pass<br>   AI verdict: Fail<br>   Analysis: The reviewer's "Pass" misses the ambiguity of the response in relation to the complex query. [cite_start]The user presented a case with multiple elements (various transactions, a rejected payment, prior instructions to complete an SEQ). [cite_start]The response only addresses a single discounted alert before instructing to "Please close this query accordingly". This fails the "Clarity" metric because it's unclear if this closure applies to the entire complex case or just the single alert, leaving the user without clear guidance on the other outstanding issues. AQUA's "Fail" is justified.<br><br>3. Action<br>   Reviewer verdict: n/a<br>   AI verdict: Pass<br>   Analysis: The reviewer's "n/a" verdict is incorrect. [cite_start]The "Action" metric requires a "clear action for the recipient to take". [cite_start]The response gives the explicit instruction: "Please close this query accordingly." This is a direct, actionable command. AQUA correctly identifies this as a "Pass" because a clear action is present, regardless of its contextual clarity. |

| [cite_start]Client is enquiring about making a payment to Belarusian tax authorities. [cite_start]Client wants to know if it is possible to process this payment through HSBC on HSBCnet and, if so, do they need to provide any further details...? | [cite_start]...triggered a sanctions review today... I will now close this case. any further necessary guidance steps will be confirmed following... the completed review. | 1. Clarity: <br>   Verdict: n/a<br><br>2. Rationale<br>   Verdict: n/a | 1. Clarity: <br>   Verdict: Fail<br>   AI Reasoning: The response does not clearly address the client's query about processing payments through HSBCnet.<br><br>2. Rationale: <br>   Verdict: Fail<br>   AI Reasoning: No rationale is provided for the actions taken or why a sanctions review was triggered. | 1. Clarity<br>   Reviewer verdict: n/a<br>   AI verdict: Fail<br>   Analysis: The reviewer's "n/a" is incorrect; the advice is simply unclear. [cite_start]The client asked a direct question: "is it possible to process this payment?" and "what details are needed?". The response answers neither. [cite_start]It announces an internal process and closes the ticket, failing to provide guidance on HOW the user should proceed. This leaves the user without an answer for their client. AQUA is correct to mark this as a "Fail" for "Clarity".<br><br>2. Rationale<br>   Reviewer verdict: n/a<br>   AI verdict: Fail<br>   Analysis: The "n/a" verdict is incorrect as a rationale is applicable but missing. [cite_start]The response states that a review was triggered and the case closed, but does not explain WHY these actions were taken. A proper rationale would explain that payments to Belarus mandate a sanctions review and clarify why the query ticket is being closed before a final answer is available. This omission violates the "Rationale" metric, making AQUA's "Fail" verdict correct. |

| ...please find attached a CSRA and SEQ renewal form for our client... The underlying client has an indirect sanctions exposure via his holding in an existing bond for Evraz Group... I would be grateful if you could please review the attached forms and provide your approval. | Hi Amanda<br><br>Apologies, for some reason the system won't allow me to attached the approved CSRA, I will send it over to you by e-mail instead for your records. | 2. Rationale<br>   Verdict: n/a<br><br>3. Action<br>   Verdict: Pass | 2. Rationale: <br>   Verdict: Fail<br>   AI Reasoning: No rationale is provided for why the system won't allow attachment.<br><br>3. Action<br>   Verdict: n/a<br>   AI Reasoning: No specific action is required from Amanda in the response. | 2. Rationale<br>   Reviewer verdict: n/a<br>   AI verdict: Fail<br>   Analysis: A rationale for the advised action (emailing the document) is applicable, making "n/a" incorrect. [cite_start]The response provides a reason ("system won't allow me") but couches it with "for some reason," explicitly admitting the 'why' is unknown. [cite_start]This is not a "clear and justifiable rationale" as the metric requires. It's a statement of a problem, not a justified reason for it. AQUA's "Fail" verdict is correct as the provided rationale is incomplete and superficial.<br><br>3. Action<br>   Reviewer verdict: Pass<br>   AI verdict: n/a<br>   Analysis: The reviewer is incorrect. [cite_start]The "Action" metric measures if there is a clear action for the recipient (Amanda) to take. [cite_start]The advisor's response, "I will send it over to you by e-mail", describes an action the advisor will perform. No action or task is assigned to Amanda. Therefore, AQUA's "n/a" verdict is the correct assessment. |

| Does HSBC have any restrictions on international payments to non sanctioned Russian banks?<br><br>Do you know of any Russian banks that HSBC are able to send money to...? | Hi Daniel<br><br>Thanks for your referral<br><br>Unfortunately, we are unable to provide advice... however have attached the link to our External Sanctions Policy... we do not discriminate someone based on their nationality... apologise that I cannot provide any further guidance... | 1. Clarity: <br>   Verdict: Pass<br><br>3. Action<br>   Verdict: Pass | 1. Clarity<br>   Verdict: Fail<br>   AI Reasoning: The response does not clearly explain how the customer can comply with HSBC policies regarding payments to Russia.<br><br>3. Action<br>   Verdict: n/a<br>   AI Reasoning: No specific action is expected or applicable as the advice states they cannot provide further guidance. | 1. Clarity<br>   Reviewer verdict: Pass<br>   AI verdict: Fail<br>   Analysis: The user asked two specific questions about making payments to Russia. [cite_start]The response explicitly states, "we are unable to provide advice" and points to a generic policy document. [cite_start]This fails the "Clarity" metric because it does not provide an easy-to-understand answer explaining HOW the user can proceed. Forcing a user to interpret a complex policy document to answer their direct questions is the opposite of clear advice. AQUA's "Fail" verdict is justified.<br><br>3. Action<br>   Reviewer verdict: Pass<br>   AI verdict: n/a<br>   Analysis: The reviewer's "Pass" is incorrect. [cite_start]The "Action" metric requires a "clear action for the recipient to take (if applicable)". [cite_start]The advisor's response explicitly states they "cannot provide any further guidance", thereby assigning no task or action to the recipient. The correct verdict is "n/a," as applied by AQUA. |

| [cite_start]TMF have asked if they can receive a payment from the following customer of theirs, please advise if this is allowed and what information is required. [cite_start]This will be received into a UK HSBC account.<br><br>Lukoil Personnel OOD... | Priti, if you have no further update for the above question please would you close the query. Thanks. | 1. Clarity: <br>   Verdict: Pass<br><br>2. Rationale<br>   Verdict: Pass<br><br>3. Action<br>   Verdict: n/a | 1. Clarity: <br>   Verdict: Fail<br>   AI Reasoning: The response does not provide any clear advice or steps for the recipient to follow.<br><br>2. Rationale: <br>   Verdict: Fail<br>   AI Reasoning: There is no rationale provided in the response to explain why closing the query is appropriate.<br><br>3. Action<br>   Verdict: Pass<br>   AI Reasoning: The action to close the query is suggested, although it's unclear if this addresses the user's question. | 1. Clarity<br>   Reviewer verdict: Pass<br>   AI verdict: Fail<br>   Analysis: The reviewer's "Pass" is incorrect. [cite_start]The user asked for specific advice: "is this allowed and what information is required?". The response provides no advice at all. [cite_start]Instead, it is an internal instruction to a colleague ("Priti") to close the query. [cite_start]This completely fails to tell the original user HOW to proceed, thus failing the "Clarity" metric. AQUA's "Fail" is correct.<br><br>2. [cite_start]Rationale<br>   Reviewer verdict: Pass<br>   AI verdict: Fail<br>   Analysis: The response advises closing the query but gives no reason WHY this is the appropriate action. Has the query been answered elsewhere? Is it invalid? [cite_start]The "Rationale" metric requires a "clear and justifiable rationale for the advice". As no justification is provided, the reviewer's "Pass" is wrong, and AQUA's "Fail" is correct.<br><br>3. Action<br>   Reviewer verdict: n/a<br>   AI verdict: Pass<br>   Analysis: The reviewer incorrectly marked this as "n/a". [cite_start]The response contains a clear instruction for its recipient, Priti: "please would you close the query." [cite_start]This fits the metric's definition of a "clear action for the recipient to take", even if the action itself doesn't resolve the original user's problem. AQUA correctly identifies that an action is present and assigns a "Pass". |
