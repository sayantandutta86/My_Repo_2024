6. Model Methodology

The Qradar framework is designed to assess the complexity of user queries to determine their suitability for handling by a Gen-AI assistant. The framework has 2 primary objectives, and the solution was developed, tested, and validated in a single comprehensive phase.

When the historical query data from January 2021 to January 2024 became available for analysis, solution development for both objectives commenced. This data, containing 2,676 unique query records, was used for the development, testing, and validation of the rule-based system.

The development process for Objective 1 involved creating a rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodology to identify queries where the user seeks approval, permission, or clearance. This process included significant experimentation with linguistic parsing techniques, Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, and dependency patterns to detect specific sentence structures. The solution was refined through iterative validation and enhancement of the linguistic patterns and the high-risk term list.

For Objective 2, a methodology was developed to identify queries that contain references to information outside the Gen-AI's knowledge base, such as attachments or alphanumeric codes. This involved analyzing query metadata and performing keyword searches for external references and sensitive terms.

The final solution integrates the outcomes from both objectives to assign a complexity level, ensuring queries are appropriately routed.

All details of solution development for Objective 1 and Objective 2 are documented below –

Objective 1 - Identify Query Intent Seeking Approval

This solution identifies if a user query has the intent to seek approval, permission, or clearance from the advisor, marking it as higher complexity. The target is a binary outcome (seeking approval or not). The data for this objective were the 2,676 historical user queries from 2021-2024 where the text was in English.

The methodology involves a multi-step, rule-based NLP process:

1. Linguistic Parsing: Each query is parsed at the sentence level to identify sentences containing high-risk terms (e.g., 'approval', 'clearance', 'permission').
2. Pattern Recognition: Using Part-of-Speech (POS) tags and Dependency Parsing, specific grammatical patterns around these high-risk terms are identified. Sample patterns include:
   · Pattern-1: VERB + PRON (your) + NOUN (high-risk term)
   · Pattern-2: VERB(ROOT) + NOUN + NOUN (high-risk term)
   · Pattern-3: VERB(ROOT, seek) + NOUN (high-risk term)
3. Flagging: Queries containing one or more of these validated patterns are flagged as fulfilling Objective 1 criteria.

The list of high-risk terms and the linguistic patterns were refined and validated through manual analysis of the query corpus to ensure accuracy and coverage.

Objective 2 - Identify External References & Sensitive Scenarios

This solution flags queries that rely on information not accessible to the Gen-AI model, such as file attachments or external reference IDs, increasing the complexity and risk of an illusionary response.

The methodology for Objective 2 uses a combined approach:

· Rule-2: External References: Queries are flagged if they meet one of the following criteria:
  · The query metadata shows an attachment count greater than zero.
  · The query text mentions the existence of an attachment (e.g., "as attached").
  · The query contains specific alphanumeric references (e.g., case IDs, account numbers) suggesting external context.
· Sensitive Scenarios: Queries are also scanned for the presence of sensitive keywords (e.g., "breach", "alert") which, if found, contribute to a higher complexity classification.

Complexity Level Determination

The outcomes from Objective 1 and Objective 2 are synthesized to assign a final complexity level:

· High Complexity: A query flagged by either Objective 1 or Objective 2 and containing sensitive keywords.
· Medium Complexity: A query flagged by either Objective 1 or Objective 2, but containing no sensitive keywords.
· Low Complexity: A query not flagged by either objective. These are deemed suitable for the Gen-AI assistant.

The entire framework was validated using the available dataset from 2021-2024 to ensure the rules effectively categorized query complexity.
