Subject: Inputs Required from RSR Advisors to Tailor the QRadar Solution

Hi [Advisor’s Name],

To effectively tailor the QRadar solution to RSR use cases, we’ll need your inputs on the following areas. The goal is to better understand the query landscape, data dependencies, and associated risks within RSR operations.

1. Classification of Queries

Please share your understanding of what constitutes a simple vs. complex query in the RSR process.

It would help if you could provide 2–3 examples of each type to illustrate how they differ in complexity and handling effort.


2. System and Data Dependencies

Identify the types of queries where advisors need to access internal systems or tools (beyond policy documents) to retrieve additional information.

Specify what kind of data or systems are typically accessed for such queries.


3. Policy-Document-Only Queries

Highlight the types of queries that can be accurately resolved using only policy documents—no system access required.

Examples here will help us identify lower-risk, self-contained query categories.


4. Risk Assessment

Outline the key risk factors associated with different query types (for example: data sensitivity, client impact, or potential compliance risk if mishandled).

If available, mention any existing controls or review mechanisms in place for higher-risk queries.


These inputs will help us define the right logic and data access requirements for the QRadar configuration. Please share the details in whichever format is most convenient (document, spreadsheet, or brief discussion points).

Best regards,
Sayantan Dutta
Data Scientist – HSBC

Would you like me to make this a bit shorter and more conversational, as if you’re sending it via Teams chat instead of email?
