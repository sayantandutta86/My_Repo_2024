Based on the queries presented in the document "abc alert queries .pdf", here are scenarios where an LLM might be unsuitable for providing a response, requiring human intervention instead:
1. Queries Requiring Investigation or External Context Beyond Policy Documents:
 * ASK-145833: This query involves investigating potential procedural violations in NGO donation projects (e.g., unapproved expenses, deviation from project plans) and determining if they constitute "Potential or actual bribery and corruption" even when no direct bribery is indicated. This requires judgment and potentially investigation beyond standard policy definitions.
 * ASK-131212: This involves reviewing specific, non-standard anti-bribery/corruption clauses for an aircraft financing deal in Turkey, comparing them against standard provisions, and assessing their acceptability from an ABC and AML perspective. This requires legal/compliance expertise to interpret bespoke clauses in a specific transactional context.
 * ASK-112112: This deals with a failure to log charitable giving in the system for an employee now on maternity leave. Determining the next steps involves procedural knowledge beyond simple policy lookup, considering the employee's absence and the retrospective nature of the issue.
 * ASK-39955: This query concerns a third-party agent (customs agent) identified after payment, requiring assessment of due diligence completion and deciding on breach classification and reporting procedures (Non-PCC breach vs. OCT submission) based on potential further findings. This involves investigation status and risk assessment.
 * ASK-1404: This involves escalating a case concerning a company facing trial for embezzlement and fraud, requiring assessment of potential sanctions/fines and determining if further scrutiny is needed beyond the available details. This needs risk assessment based on external legal proceedings.
 * ASK-61354: This complex case involves a customer admitting funds sent to the Philippines were potentially a bribe, but transaction references suggest construction. Determining if this falls within the bank's risk appetite requires significant investigation, context analysis, and judgment beyond policy text.
 * ASK-63077: Assessing the implications of a bribery case involving a joint operation partner (WIKA) requires understanding external legal proceedings and the partner's specific role (witness vs. suspect) to determine the risk impact.
 * ASK-71357: This query asks for validation of specific ABC clauses in a refinancing term sheet that deviate from standard HSBC guidelines, particularly regarding the absence of money laundering clauses common in Nordic deals. This requires expert judgment on non-standard contractual terms.
 * ASK-78525: Similar to ASK-71357, this involves reviewing and approving specific AML/ABC clauses within a French financing term sheet (Projet Sertrags) against standards. This requires expertise in contractual compliance.
 * ASK-87418: This involves assessing a vendor interaction where the vendor became irate and made potentially coercive statements during a tender process. Determining the appropriate escalation procedure (Helios entry, IRIS report) requires careful judgment of the interaction against AB&C and procurement policies.
 * ASK-90259 / ASK-97666 (Duplicate Entry): This detailed query involves assessing complex ABC and sanctions clauses for a large project financing deal (Project Amiral) in Saudi Arabia. It requires comparing bespoke clauses against precedent financing and standard policies, considering specific mitigants, and understanding complex financing structures (ECA tranches, DSUs, shared security). This is highly specialized and requires legal/compliance expertise far beyond standard policy retrieval.
2. Queries Involving Ambiguity or Requiring Complex Interpretation:
 * ASK-113792: This asks whether employees of a US company partially owned by the Italian government should be classified as US Public Officials or Foreign Public Officials. This requires nuanced interpretation of "Public Official" definitions across jurisdictions, potentially needing legal clarification.
 * ASK-134151: This query requires assessing the acceptability of adding a "to the best of its knowledge" qualifier to a contractual clause regarding Anti-Social Forces/Sanctions for a payroll service provider. This involves legal interpretation of contractual language modification.
 * ASK-61247: This involves determining if failing to get pre-approval for charitable giving constitutes a policy breach when post-approval was obtained, especially considering the specific policy wording on when post-approval is acceptable. This requires careful interpretation of policy exceptions.
3. Queries Dealing with System Issues or Procedural Guidance Not Explicitly in Policy:
 * ASK-143367: Adding a public official attendee to a pre-approved G&E request after the event requires understanding the specific procedure for "Material Changes" and potential system amendments within a tight timeframe.
 * ASK-142103: Amending an already approved G&E entry to reflect the correct cost requires specific procedural steps within the GER system.
 * ASK-122705: Resolving an issue where a G&E entry cannot be approved because the designated manager has left and the new manager cannot see the pending item requires troubleshooting system/process workflows.
 * ASK-118232: Following up on a G&E submission stuck in "Pending Business Decision" status requires understanding the approval workflow and potential bottlenecks.
 * ASK-41256: This describes a system challenge preventing G&E recording, requiring technical assistance or understanding of system error workarounds.
 * ASK-46866: This involves correcting a G&E submission where entering an amount in a foreign currency incorrectly exceeded limits, requiring knowledge of system handling of currencies and limits.
 * ASK-55942: Query about selecting the correct option in the GER system for an NGO that is non-IPO requires specific system usage guidance.
 * ASK-58885: Issues with setting up delegation for G&E requests require system-specific troubleshooting.
 * ASK-68385: An issue where the approval button is missing on a G&E submission screen requires technical support or system knowledge.
 * ASK-75414: User ID not being recognized by the GER system requires technical investigation.
 * ASK-84885: Similar to ASK-75414, a staff ID not being recognized when trying to add them to a team submission requires system troubleshooting.
 * ASK-95200 / ASK-78 (Typo likely refers to ASK-95200): A G&E submission stuck in "Pending Approver Change" requires understanding the workflow and how to escalate/accelerate it.
 * ASK-103304: Investigating why the GER system behaviour changed regarding the need to record low-value charitable giving requires understanding system updates or policy interpretation shifts.
These examples highlight situations where context, investigation, interpretation of complex or non-standard scenarios, legal expertise, or specific system/procedural knowledge is needed â€“ capabilities often beyond retrieving and presenting standard policy text, thus making them less suitable for a simple LLM response based solely on policy documents.
